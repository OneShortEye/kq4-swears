# King's Quest IV Swear List

King's Quest IV has swear detection. If you type a naughty word, you get a message telling you to clean up your act. There were two main versions of the game: AGI and SCI. There is some overlap between the swear lists, but many of the words are unique.

If you type one of these words in AGI, you get the response: "You were raised better than that!"

SCI will give you the response: "Perhaps you need to purchase a copy of 'Leisure Suit Larry'?"
